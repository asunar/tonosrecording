			This agreement (“Agreement”) constitutes a binding contract for videography services and/or
			products. By signing this Agreement, the clients, (collectively referred to below as “Client”) agree to pay Tonos Technology Solutions, LLC (“Company” or "We")
			for the services and/or products(the “Services”)  provided by the Company at the price set forth in this document.

			1. Scope. We render the Services on an hourly basis unless we otherwise agree in writing. 

			2. Illness and Unexpected Events: Company will not be liable to
			Client under any circumstances if its performance is prevented or impaired due to war,
			insurrection, strikes, walk-outs, riots, fire, acts of God, including adverse weather conditions
			and earthquakes, shortages or unavailability of labor or materials (power, internet connection), laws or governmental
			restrictions which conflict with the terms of this Agreement, or any other matter beyond the
			reasonable control of the Company. In the event of any unanticipated
			videographer illness Company shall make reasonable efforts to
			substitute another competent professional. If another videographer cannot be assigned in time
			for the Event, Company shall promptly return to Client all fees
			previously paid by Client, and shall then have no further liability with respect to this
			Agreement. 

			3. Video Quality / Blind spots: Videos will be recorded in HD (720p). Client agrees that due to the facility construction there may be areas that will be outside of 
			the recording area. Client confirms that client had watched a sample video recorded at the selected facility.
			Client agrees that Company will not issue any refunds for failing to record blind-spots that are outside the recording area.

			4. Change Management Process. Client agrees that there will be no post-production editing.

			5. Liquidated Damages: Client and Company recognize it is
			extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain the extent of Client’s actual damage in the
			event of a breach on the part of the Company. Therefore, the parties agree that
			in the event of any breach arising from the negligence or other unintentional conduct of
			the Company, including, without limitation, any damage to or loss of any
			recording footage, Client shall be entitled to the following: A percentage reduction in the price of the
			video package, based upon the amount of actual recording-time which has been damaged, lost or
			not captured. Client would then receive the final product, containing the footage from the
			Event, which was captured, not lost or damaged. The return of
			such fees and payment of such damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedies available to
			Client.

			6. Publicity Rights / Promotional Use: The parties agree that the Company may use videos and/or 
			images taken from videos for commercial use, including, without limitation, promotional videos,
			signs and other marketing material.

			7. Storage and Distribution: The videos will be uploaded to YouTube and the link will be emailed to
			the client within 3 business days of the event. This will conclude 

			8. Payment: 

			Individual 1 hour recording: $30/hour
			10 hours or more:		          $25/hour 

			9. Cancellations: Company will issue a full refund if Client cancels 24 hours before the event
			or earlier. Company will issue a 75% refund  if client cancels within 24 hours of the event.
